-------0x0D. C - Preprocessor-------
he preprocessor is a text-processing tool that runs before the actual compilation of your source code. It performs various text manipulations and prepares your code for compilation. The preprocessor is responsible for tasks like including header files, macro substitution, conditional compilation, and removing comments. It is an essential part of the compilation process and is invoked automatically by the compiler.
